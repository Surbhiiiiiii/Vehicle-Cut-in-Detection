Vehicle Cut-in Detection

This project aims to detect and tag objects as soon as they appear partially or fully in front of the driver. It includes the following key features:-
Object Detection and Tagging: Identifies and tags objects immediately as they appear in front of the vehicle.
Distance and Time-to-Collision (TTC) Estimation: Calculates the distance to the detected object and estimates the TTC.
Warning System: Provides a warning when the TTC falls below a predefined threshold (recommended between 0.5 and 0.7 seconds).

Key featues:-
High Accuracy: The machine learning model achieves over 99% true positives for cut-in detection.
This system enhances driver awareness and safety by alerting drivers to potential collisions, allowing for timely evasive actions.
